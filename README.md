## Enigma

**Summary**

  These are two versions of an enigma machine I created with a "workable" GUI utilising VS Studio 2017 GUI with C# and JavaSwing (Java 8.0) in Netbeans 8.2. 
Both of these were priarily created with the skills I had in High School and so don't expect them to be the most optimised.
