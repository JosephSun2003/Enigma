## Enigma

**Summary**

  These are two versions of an enigma machine I created with a "workable" GUI utilising JavaSwing (Java 8.0) in Netbeans 8.2. 
This was primarily created with the skills I had in High School and so don't expect them to be the most optimised (Or very badly made).

Note: there was a version of the program I created in HS using VS Studio with C# but that has most likely been deleted since my 
HS clears the servers every year for obvious reasons. I do however, have the prototypes utilising console.
